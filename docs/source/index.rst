Bolt: The Python Task Runner
################################################################################

Bolt is a |python|_ task runner inspired by |grunt|_ in the JavaScript world.
Bolt is design to simplify task automation and provides a flexible and extensible
interface adaptable to your project needs.


Why Use Bolt?
=============

If you are like me and dislike JavaScript as much as I do, Bolt is a breath of
fresh air. Bolt is written and can be extended using |python|_, which makes it
more readable and intuitive to use. Don't get me wrong, |grunt|_ is a great tool
that inspired me to create Bolt, but I cannot get over the ugly JavaScript syntax.
Please, don't hate me for it.
