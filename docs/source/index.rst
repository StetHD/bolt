Bolt: The Python Task Runner
################################################################################

Bolt is a |python|_ task runner inspired by |grunt|_ in the JavaScript world.
Bolt is design to simplify task automation and provides a flexible and extensible
interface adaptable to your project needs.


Why Use Bolt?
=============

If you are like me and dislike JavaScript as much as I do, Bolt is a breath of
fresh air. Bolt is written and can be extended using |python|_, which makes it
more readable and intuitive to use. Don't get me wrong, |grunt|_ is a great tool
that inspired me to create Bolt, but I cannot get over the ugly JavaScript syntax.
Please, don't hate me for it.


How Can I Get Started Using Bolt?
=================================

The best way to get started using Bolt is to go over the :doc:`User's Guide <ug/users_guide>`,
which provides information about installing bolt, creating a bolt configuration
file, and out-of-the-box provided tasks.


How Can I Extend Bolt With My Own Tasks?
========================================

Now that you are a Bolt power-user, and you are leveraging Bolt's out-of-the-box
functionality, plus some 3rd-party extensions, you are ready to create your own
tasks. The :doc:`Reference Guide <rg/reference_guide>` gives a good explanation 
on how to provide additional tasks for Bolt and documents the Bolt API.


How Can I Contribute to Bolt?
=============================

You've mastered Bolt's capabilities and want to give back to the community. That's 
great! Check out the :doc:`Developer's Guide <dg/developers_guide>` for instructions
on how to contribute to the project, and visit our |repo|_ to fork or clone the
project.
